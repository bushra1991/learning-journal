# This is Bushra Bremi
*I am a mother of two little monkeys, I like cooking and reading alot, but coding is something else for me, 
it makes my mind work in a spectacular way 
even though this course is being a little tiring and its taking so much time and effort from me, but its such an awesome experience and a pretty oportunity*
